    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A bit like a classic lasagne but there’s no béchamel and definitely less fuss altogether. It tastes absolutely
        amazing too.
    </p>
    <p>The recipe is from Mezcla by Ixta Belfrage; a book full of delicious things.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>half a large butternut squash, peeled and seeds discarded (about 500g)</li>
        <li>400g ripe cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>2¾ tsp fine salt</li>
        <li>5g fresh sage leaves, roughly chopped, plus 10 extra leaves to serve</li>
        <li>6 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to finish</li>
        <li>220g double cream, plus extra 2 tbsp to serve</li>
        <li>80g Parmesan, finely grated, plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>¾ tsp freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>250g-300g dried lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>400g chicken stock (you can use veg stock if you prefer)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 220C fan/240C.</li>
        <li>Finely slice the butternut squash into very thin half moons – a mandoline is best for this or you could use
            the slicing attachment on a food processor.</li>
        <li>Mix the squash slices, tomatoes, garlic, tomato purée, fine salt, chopped sage, 4 tbsp olive oil and lots of
            black pepper, together in a large bowl. Your hands are best to toss it all together.</li>
        <li>Mix the cream, Parmesan and nutmeg together in another bowl. Set 80g of this mixture aside for later.</li>
        <li>Cover the bottom of a baking dish (approx. 28cm x 23cm) with a layer of lasagne sheets, then a layer of the
            squash mixture. Spoon over some of the cream mixture, then continue the layering until you have used
            everything. Pour the stock evenly over everything in th edish, then cover tightly with foil and bake for 50
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and remove the foil. Spoon over the reserved 80g of cream mixture and return to the
            oven, uncovered, for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix 2 tbsp of the oil with the 10 sage leaves in a small bowl. Spoon this over the lasagne and return to the
            oven for a final 5-6 minutes, or until the sage leaves look crisp and the lasagne golden-brown.</li>
        <li>Rest for 10 minutes, then finish with the 2 tbsp of cream, a good drizzle of olive oil and plenty of extra
            grated Parmesan, sea salt and black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
