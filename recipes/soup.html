    <h3 class="caption">Description</h3>
    <p>In the words of original author: "Kielbasa is perfectly suited to soup because of the complexity of flavour it
        lends as it simmers", but subbing in an equivalent italian/veggie sausage works fine too.</p>
    <p class="caption">The recipe is from Cook This Book by Molly Baz</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list ingredients">
        <li>2 celery stalks</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 pound green or napa cabbage</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh dill leaves</li>
        <li>12 ounces kielbasa</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tsps salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>3 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cans white beans</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>Sour Cream for serving (or whole-milk plain Greek Yogurt)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="list steps">
        <li>Mise-en-place: thinly slice the garlic; cut up the onion; cut the celery into ¼ inch-thick half-moons;
            reduce the cabbage to quarters, cut out the core, and cut the leaves into 1” wide strips; split the kielbasa
            in half lengthwise, and cut each half into ½” wide half-moons.</li>
        <li>Build the Base: Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium high heat. Add the kielbasa, and cook
            without moving for 4-5 minutes, to build a golden-brown crust and fond. Stir, and cook another 2-3 minutes.
            Add in the garlic, celery, and onion, and cook, lowering to medium heat, until onion is translucent, about 5
            minutes. Add in the cabbage, salt, and A LOT of black pepper, tossing to coat cabbage in oil, and stirring
            often, until cabbage has softened, roughly another 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, and cook off for 2-3
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in beans and water, stirring to incorporate, and intentionally smashing around 1/3rd cup of the beans
            against the sides of the pot, so their released starch can thicken the soup. Return heat to medium-high, and
            bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat, and simmer 15 minute, until thickened. </li>
        <li>Season with additional salt and pepper to taste. Ladle into bowls, and top with a dollop of sour cream,
            additional black pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. </li>
    </ol>
