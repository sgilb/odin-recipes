        <p>Kimchi varies enormously in quality and saltiness. Buy the best you can and adjust the seasoning to suit you.

        <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="list ingredients">
            <li>2 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp toasted sesame oil, plus extra to serve</li>
            <li>3 fat garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</li>
            <li>150g kimchi, drained and finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tsp gochugaru (Korean red pepper powder)</li>
            <li>2 tsp agave or brown rice syrup</li>
            <li>1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes – I like Mutti’s polpa</li>
            <li>Fine sea salt</li>
            <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list steps">
            <li>Pour the rapeseed oil and a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil into a medium saucepan on a medium heat
                and,
                when hot, add the garlic and cook for two minutes, until pale gold. Add the kimchi and stir-fry for a
                few
                minutes, until all the water has been driven off and the oil has visibly separated.</li>
            <li>Stir in the gochugaru and syrup, then add the tomatoes and bring to a bubble. Turn down the heat,
                three-quarters cover with a lid (as the sauce thickens, it may spit), and leave to cook for 15-20
                minutes,
                stirring irregularly, until it has thickened nicely. Season to taste (the saltiness of kimchi will vary
                – I
                used three-quarters to a teaspoon of salt).</li>
            <li>In the meantime, make the breadcrumbs. Put the remaining tablespoon of sesame oil in a small frying pan
                over
                a low to medium heat and, when hot, add the breadcrumbs, pine nuts and sesame seeds, and stir-fry until
                the
                breadcrumbs are crisp and golden. Stir through a pinch or two of salt and transfer to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Fill a very large pan with water, season with salt (I use a teaspoon of salt for every litre of water)
                and
                bring to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions and, just before draining,
                scoop
                out a small mug of the cooking water and put to one side.</li>
            <li>Tip the drained pasta into the sauce and toss using a spaghetti spoon or tongs, adding a little pasta
                water
                if the sauce needs loosening. Check for seasoning and adjust as you see fit.</li>
            <li>Distribute the spaghetti across four places, sprinkle the sesame breadcrumbs liberally over the top and
                drizzle over a little more sesame oil, if you wish.</li>
        </ol>
